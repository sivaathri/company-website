# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
# 9. TECHNICAL SEO CHECKLIST FOR REACT/VITE WEBSITE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════

## ✅ Core Setup
- [x] Proper `<title>` tag (unique, keyword-rich, under 60 chars)
- [x] Meta `<description>` (compelling, under 160 chars)
- [x] `<link rel="canonical">` on every page
- [x] `robots.txt` correctly configured
- [x] `sitemap.xml` generated and submitted to Google Search Console
- [x] `lang="en"` on `<html>` tag
- [x] Structured data (JSON-LD) — Local Business, FAQ, Breadcrumb

## ✅ React-Specific SEO
- [ ] Install `react-helmet-async` for dynamic meta tags per route
- [ ] Use `react-router-dom` for proper URL routing (not just hash-based)
- [ ] Enable SSR or SSG → Consider migrating to **Next.js** for full SEO benefit
  > **Important:** SPAs (like pure React/Vite) have limited SEO without SSR.
  > Googlebot can render JS, but it's slower and less reliable.
  > **Recommendation:** Add `@vitejs/plugin-react` + `vite-plugin-ssr` OR migrate to Next.js.
- [ ] Pre-render critical pages: `vite-plugin-prerender` or `react-snap`
- [ ] Ensure all text content is in DOM (not only visible after JS loads)
- [ ] 404 page with proper HTTP status code
- [ ] Redirects: `301` for any URL changes

## ✅ Performance & Core Web Vitals
- [ ] LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s
- [ ] FID/INP (Interaction to Next Paint) < 200ms
- [ ] CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1
- [ ] TTFB (Time to First Byte) < 800ms

## ✅ URL Structure
- [ ] Lowercase URLs only: `/services/web-development` ✅
- [ ] Hyphens not underscores: `web-development` not `web_development` ✅
- [ ] No trailing slashes inconsistency
- [ ] No `?id=123` style URLs for important pages

## ✅ Mobile SEO
- [ ] `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` ✅
- [ ] All tap targets ≥ 44×44px
- [ ] No horizontal scroll on mobile
- [ ] Font size ≥ 16px for body text
- [ ] Mobile-friendly test: https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly

## ✅ Security & Trust
- [ ] HTTPS (SSL certificate) enabled on production
- [ ] HSTS header enabled
- [ ] No mixed content warnings
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

---

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
# 10. CORE WEB VITALS IMPROVEMENT TIPS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════

## LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) — Target: < 2.5s
- Preload the hero image: `<link rel="preload" as="image" href="/hero.webp">`
- Convert all images to **WebP** format (30–50% smaller)
- Serve images from CDN (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront)
- Avoid render-blocking resources (large CSS, fonts)
- Use `loading="eager"` for hero image, `loading="lazy"` for below-fold

## INP (Interaction to Next Paint) — Target: < 200ms
- Minimize main-thread blocking JavaScript
- Use `React.memo()` for expensive components
- Split large components with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`
- Remove unused Framer Motion animations on mobile
- Debounce scroll event handlers

## CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) — Target: < 0.1
- Always define `width` and `height` on `<img>` tags
- Use CSS `aspect-ratio` for image containers
- Avoid injecting content above existing content
- Reserve space for fonts with `font-display: swap`
- Avoid dynamically inserted ads/banners

## TTFB (Time to First Byte) — Target: < 800ms
- Use Cloudflare (free tier) as CDN and edge cache
- Enable Gzip/Brotli compression on hosting
- Optimize server response from hosting provider
- Pre-compute API responses where possible

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
# 11. PAGE SPEED OPTIMIZATION STEPS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════

## Step 1: Optimize Images
```bash
# Install sharp for image optimization
npm install sharp vite-imagetools

# Convert images to WebP using CLI
npx sharp input.png -o output.webp

# In Vite config, enable image optimization
import { imagetools } from 'vite-imagetools';
plugins: [react(), imagetools()]
```

## Step 2: Code Splitting & Tree Shaking
```jsx
// Lazy load below-fold components
const WhyChooseUs = React.lazy(() => import('./components/WhyChooseUs'));
const Contact = React.lazy(() => import('./components/Contact'));

// Wrap in Suspense
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <WhyChooseUs />
</Suspense>
```

## Step 3: Optimize Framer Motion
```jsx
// Only import what you use — avoid importing entire library
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';  // ✅ already correct

// Reduce animations on low-power devices
import { useReducedMotion } from 'framer-motion';
const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion();
```

## Step 4: Font Optimization
```html
<!-- Fonts already preloaded — also add display=swap -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700;800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
```

## Step 5: Vite Build Optimization
```js
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
          motion: ['framer-motion'],
          icons: ['lucide-react'],
        },
      },
    },
    minify: 'esbuild',
    target: 'esnext',
    cssMinify: true,
  },
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

## Step 6: Hosting Recommendations
| Option | Price | CDN | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare Pages | Free | ✅ Global CDN | ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ |
